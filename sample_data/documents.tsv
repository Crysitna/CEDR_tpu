doc	FBIS4-67701	CSO [Text] Ahmedabad, February 13--Poliomyelitis, one of the childhood's crippling scourges, will soon be a disease of the past in Gujarat, thanks to the massive vaccination programme that was launched by the state government some eight years back. Already Gujarat stands on the threshold of totally wiping it out; it is in `control grade'. By the end of the present century, just six years from now, the dreaded disease will be declared "eradicated," as is the goal set by the World Health Organisation and the Centre, the minister of state for health, Mr. Shaktisinh Gohil, confidently says. Already, consulting paediatricians and orthopaedic surgeons conform the decline in cases. In fact, Dr. Kumar Nathani, a city paediatrician, said he had seen just seven new cases of polio during the last seven years. "All we treat now are the old cases," said Dr. Nathani and his physiotherapist wife, Yamini. An orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Bharat Bhagat, also asserts that the disease is fast declining. He should know, being the managing trustee of Polio Foundation, which has organised 40 free polio camps till date, where 15,600 cases, mostly old cases, were examined and 2,120 corrective surgical operations were performed. Government statistics show that in the first year of the massive vaccination programme launched in 1985-86, as many as 1,012 cases were registered in Gujarat. This fell to 650 in 1986-87, 156 in 1987-88, then went on rising to 323 in 1991-92 and then fell again during the last two years to 77 till November last. As per the survey report in June 1993, declining trends in the occurrence of poliomyelitis are being recorded at the national level, as well as in many well-performing states and within several districts of other states. The national mass vaccination programme, launched by the Centre since 1985-86, has also made a significant dent in the occurrence of polio cases. In a single 12-month period, 20 million children were contacted at least five times, it adds. Before launching of the mass vaccination programme, the virulence of the disease in the country was so extensive that every year some 200,000 children used to suffer from the disease and 2,000 of them used to die. According to a survey conducted by the Union government then, over 60 per cent of the children became lame due to polio before reaching their second birthday. Percent-wise polio resulting in physical deformities was 67.6 in urban areas, while in the rural areas, the percent was even higher--up to 71.6. In Gujarat, for instance, it was reported to be 69 and 71.7 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively. Mr. Gohil states that the government took special care to enlist the help of panchayats and anganwadi workers to reach ashram schools and anganwadis in deep interiors and inaccessible areas to make the programme really effective. To avert the usual occurrence of the disease on a wider scale during the monsoon months, the minister says that a mop-up system has been put in practice, where two doses of polio vaccine are administered to all children up to the age of three years in March and April. From the beginning of the massive vaccination drive, the government took the help of local bodies, medical associations and also several voluntary organisations, like Rotary Club, the latter even launching a `Polio Plus' programme of its own. The government, and the medical profession aver that the credit for the success must go to the mass media, particularly to the visual TV media, which gave wide and regular publicity to the programme, educating the masses, both in the urban and rural areas. The `control grade' for polio, which Gujarat has attained, is a predecessor to the `elimination grade', when not a single case is registered in any of the districts. The next stage will be one where not a single case is registered in a three-year period. This will come around the year 2,000, it is expected. Specific goals set up by the government for other diseases include elimination of neonatal tetanus in all districts by 1995, reduction in measles cases by 90 per cent by 1995 compared to the 1985 level, reduction of deaths and cases due to diarrohoeal diseases by 30 per cent and ten per cent by 1985 and 70 per cent and 25 per cent by the end of this century. According to many private doctors and specialists, this mass vaccination programme for various childhood diseases has been most effective and the declining trend is not confined to poliomyelitis, but also in other childhood scourges such as measles, diptheria, whooping cough and neonatal tetanus, which cause deaths, debilities and deformities (physical). They are also confident, like the government, that these diseases will be declared eradicated in Gujarat in the coming years in the same fashion as small pox was declared eradicated from the world women 18 years ago.[sentence as printed]
doc	LA043090-0036	April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; POLIO LOOKS TO BE ON THE WAY OUT International health officials predicted last week that they probably will succeed in eliminating polio from the Western Hemisphere by the end of this year, a major step in a campaign to eradicate the crippling disease from the globe by the year 2000. Polio, or poliomyelitis, caused by a virus in contaminated water and food, produced tens of thousands of cases of paralysis annually in the United States until the first effective vaccine was introduced in 1954. So far this year, despite intensive case-tracking efforts, only three confirmed cases of polio caused by the natural virus have been found in the Americas, compared with 45 by this time last year, said Ciro de Quadros, regional adviser to the Expanded Program of Immunization for the Pan American Health Organization. Rare cases of paralytic polio also occur in recipients of the live-virus vaccine. Because of successful vaccination programs, polio cases in the Western Hemisphere have been declining steeply over the last decade, from about 6,000 annually in the late 1970s to 132 last year. Polio is a far bigger problem in the Eastern Hemisphere, causing more than 200,000 cases of paralysis annually.
doc	FBIS3-12298	Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Unattributed talk] [Text] Brothers: There is no doubt that the hideous crime perpetrated by a clique of Zionist settlers, in collaboration with Israeli military commanders, against our people in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a natural outcome of the continuation of occupation and the continuation of genocide against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland. Within this context, the crime puts the peace process at a serious crossroad. This requires urgent measures to uproot its causes. The ugly crime -- in which many martyrs and injured fell at the hands of the herds of settlers who enjoy official Israeli protection and support -- shows that peace will remain fragile as long as the settlements are still there and as long as the herds of settlers do whatever they want, carry out systematic killing against our people, and encroach on their sanctities in front of the international community which is turning a deaf ear to its own calls on human rights and liquidation of colonialism. The crime, which has shaken the conscience of official and popular world public opinion, [break in transmission for 3 seconds] just denunciation, condemnation, and regret. It is a warning to all those who are involved in the peace process to review their stands and prove their credibility toward the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to their land and homeland. What took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque was not an accident, but an organized crime for which the Israeli leadership -- which is still alleging that it is concerned about security and peace in the region -- is responsible. It is an ugly crime in which the Palestinian blood was shed to put everyone to the test, particularly the United States in its capacity as the main sponsor of the peace process. The crime has dealt a severe blow to this process and warns of dangers whose future dimensions cannot be predicted. The Ibrahimi Mosque crime shows the consequences of not providing international protection for the Palestinian people under the yoke of occupation. This issue does not tolerate any indifference or postponement under the pretext of giving the Israeli authorities enough time to look into the matter. Experiments showed that the Israeli authorities only aim at repressing and annihilating the Palestinians. They are far away from the truth regarding their claims to provide them with security and safety. Colonialists are only concerned about their own security, entrenching their occupation of land, annihilating its people. It is time for the international community, particularly the Security Council, to look into the bare facts and take urgent measures to provide international protection for the Palestinian people. It is also time for the United States -- if it is really interested in rendering the peace process a success -- to practice its influence on the Isareli leadership to bring it to the right path. The Palestinian people have made great sacrifices, but they never weakened. Palestinian blood was never cheap and will never be so.

Responsibility for the implementation of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Decree "On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution" (hereinafter referred to as the amnesty decree) is placed: (a) on the bodies responsible for enforcing punishment -- for convicted persons kept in places of detention. Implementation of the amnesty decree is effected in accordance with a decision of the chief of the corrective labor institution sanctioned by a prosecutor. The following are attached to this decision: a record of rewards and sanctions, the convicted person's personal file, and other documents needed to decide on the application of an act of amnesty; (b) on inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies -- for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being processed by these bodies; (c) on courts: for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being processed by the courts and had not been examined prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree, and also for persons whose criminal cases have been examined but sentences have not come legally into force; for convicted persons for whom the enforcement of sentences has been deferred in instances and under the procedure stipulated by law and persons who have received a conditional sentence in accordance with Article 44 of the RSFSR Criminal Code (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by a court following a submission by the internal affairs body monitoring the convicted person's conduct); for persons sentenced to be fined, if the fine has not been paid prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which passed sentence); for persons released on parole and persons who have had the unserved part of their sentence commuted prior to the coming into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which made the ruling to allow parole or commute the unserved part of a sentence); for persons sentenced by Russian Federation courts who are serving their sentence on the territory of other states which were formerly part of the USSR (a ruling on the application of an act of amnesty is made by the court which passed sentence); (d) on internal affairs bodies: for persons whose sentences have come legally into force and who have been sentenced to imprisonment but who are not in custody; for persons serving their sentence in the form of corrective work not involving custody or disqualification from the holding of given posts or from given activities; (e) on the commands of disciplinary battalions -- for servicemen sentenced to be assigned to a disciplinary battalion. 2. A decision on the application or nonapplication of an act of amnesty is adopted for each person individually. In the absence of necessary information on the convicted person examination of the question of the application of an amnesty is deferred pending the receipt of additional materials. Bodies responsible for the implementation of the amnesty decree are granted the right to demand that the institutions in question provide court files and other materials needed to decide questions linked with the application of an amnesty. Such demands must be met immediately. 3. Decisions on the application of an act of amnesty adopted by inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies, internal affairs bodies, and also the commands of disciplinary battalions are sanctioned by a prosecutor. When an act of amnesty is applied by courts the participation of a prosecutor is mandatory. 4. The amnesty decree applies to persons who committed crimes prior to the entry into force of the present decree. 5. It is to be explained that when an act of amnesty is applied: (a) subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons who: served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed Forces during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945; participated in the Great Patriotic War as a member of a partisan detachment, people's volunteer militia, extermination battalion, or underground organization operating against the German occupationists; served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed Forces which participated in combat operations against Japan in 1945. Subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons awarded the "Victory Over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45" medal or the "Victory Over Japan" medal and also to persons who participated in combat operations to defend the interests of the USSR during the period preceding the Great Patriotic War or after it ended; to persons who participated in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl AES accident and are entitled to special benefits; and also to persons who have performed military service on the territory of the Transcaucasus and Baltic states and the Republic of Tajikistan; (b) subparagraph "b" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree also applies to female minors; (c) subparagraph "c" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to males born before 1 January 1934; (d) subparagraph "d" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons deemed by the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population to be Group 1 and Group 2 invalids prior to the coming into force of this decree, and also to persons deemed by a Medical and Labor Commission of a Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs medical department to be Group 1 or Group 2 invalids, following confirmation of the group by a commission of the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population within six months of the entry into force of the amnesty decree; (e) paragraph 2 of the amnesty decree does not apply to persons who, in addition to a crime committed through negligence, have also been convicted of a crime committed deliberately; (f) paragraph 3 of the amnesty decree applies to males born after 1 January 1976; (g) the served part of a sentence stipulated in paragraphs 2 and 5 of the amnesty decree is calculated to the date that the present decree comes into force. 6. The serving of a sentence in the form of noncustodial corrective work ends from the day that internal affairs bodies file a decision on the application of an act of amnesty approved by a prosecutor. 7. The amnesty decree does not extend to persons subject to administrative punishment, including persons culpable under administrative law but freed from criminal liability in accordance with the procedure stipulated by Articles 50 and 51 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. 8. When applying an act of amnesty to persons whose length of sentence has been reduced by pardon or amnesty, it is necessary to proceed from the length of sentence prescribed in accordance with the acts of pardon or amnesty. 9. Amnestied persons are released from both their basic punishment and additional punishment if the latter has not been carried out by the date that the amnesty decree comes into force. 10. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the amnesty decree the part of the sentence which has not been served on the date that the said decree comes into forces is eligible for reduction. This point applies to convicted persons whose sentences have entered legally into force prior to the entry into force of the said decree. 11. When applying the amnesty decree convictions which have been quashed or lifted in accordance with the procedure stipulated by law and also convictions for crimes which have been excised from the RSFSR Criminal Code are disregarded. Furthermore, the convictions of persons previously convicted for crimes of negligence, irrespective of the form of punishment, and also of persons sentenced for premediated crimes to noncustodial punishment are disregarded. 12. Malicious violators of the terms [governing the serving of their sentence] are to be defined as persons who: (a) systematically violate established discipline and order while serving their sentence; (b) have been convicted, interned in deportation colonies, or sent to other types of corrective labor colonies if, after the court ruling that they be sent to a corrective labor institution, they have been in custody for less than one year on the day that the materials relating to the application of an act of amnesty is examined. The term is calculated from the date that the convicted person is taken into custody; (c) persons sentenced to noncustodial corrective work who, because they have deliberately evaded serving their sentence, have their unserved term of corrective work replaced by a custodial sentence, if they have been in custody for less than six months on the date that the materials relating to the application of an act of amnesty are examined. 13. In accordance with subparagraph "e" of paragraph 8 of the amnesty decree an act of amnesty cannot be applied to persons released early from custody since 1985 (irrespective of whether their conviction has been quashed or lifted) under the pardons procedure or on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium decrees: "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 40th Anniversary of the Soviet People's Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45," dated 26 April 1985; "On the Release From Detention of Certain Categories of Women," dated 6 November 1986; "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 70th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," dated 18 June 1987; and also on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet decree of 28 November 1989 "On an Amnesty for Former Servicemen of the Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan Who Have Committed Crimes," the USSR law of 1 November 1991 "On an Amnesty for Servicemen Who Have Evaded Military Service," and the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree of 18 June 1992 "On an Amnesty." Convicted persons who have been released in connection with the reduction of their sentence under the pardons procedure or on the basis of the aforementioned acts and persons who have had the unserved part of a term of detention commuted should also be regarded as having been granted early release from punishment. 14. Materials relating to persons affected by the amnesty decree who have had been ordered under the prescribed procedure to undergo treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, or venereal disease are examined after the convicted persons have completed the complete course of treatment but no later than six months after the completion of the implementation of the amnesty decree. The grounds for deeming that a course of treatment for venereal disease has been completed are a medical ruling or -- in the case of persons for whom a court has prescribed compulsory treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction -- a court ruling on terminating the compulsory treatment. 15. The amnesty decree also applies to persons who were convicted by USSR courts on the territory of another state and are serving their sentence on the territory of the Russian Federation. 16. In cases when the question of the application of an act of amnesty arises after the expiry of a six-month period from the day that the amnesty decree comes into force, application of the act is effected in accordance with the procedure stipulated by paragraph 1 of the said decree. 17. The regulation personnel strength of corrective labor institutions and remand centers and also of the prisoner escort service is not to be reduced. 18. Organs of executive power of the components of the Russian Federation are to ensure monitoring of the implementation of the amnesty decree. 19. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are to: (a) organize prompt record-keeping on all persons released from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree and make everyday and job arrangements for them no later that 15 days after they arrive in their place of residence; (b) find places in homes for the disabled for invalids and elderly persons who have been released from punishment and do not have relatives able to support them. 20. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are to ensure that juveniles released from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree are promptly included in their records when they arrive in their place of residence, passed into the supervision of parents or guardianship and wardship agencies, and found places when necessary in children's homes, boarding schools, or vocational and technical colleges and to coordinate the work of commissions for juvenile affairs, internal affairs bodies, and social organizations to reeducate juveniles released from punishment.

Klimov report on interview with Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council; place and date not given: "How Much Does Law and Order Cost? The Security Council Has Examined the Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight Against Crime"] [Text] Something which has been discussed many times in the mass media, and has always -- especially recently -- provoked heightened interest, has come to pass. Yesterday the Russian Federation Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight Against Crime for 1994-1995 was examined in the country's Security Council and, after criticisms had been taken into account, was recommended to be sent for ratification by the Russian Federation president. The draft program is a Morocco-bound book comprising 84 pages. Not many, one might think, but it is the quintessence of the colossal labor of many people. The book is divided into two parts. The first part examines today's requirements, the second examines long-term prospects. Everything is terse and absolutely clear: Urgent measures for intensifying the fight against crime are denoted, and the specific officials charged with implementing them are defined. What is the essence of the federal program? What does it promise for Russians in the future? How did work on it proceed? Our observer Vladimir Klimov turned to Vladimir Arsentyevich Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, for answers to these questions. [Rubanov] The program enables efforts to be concentrated in terms of time, place, and purpose. The legislator works in harness with law-enforcement organs, and they in turn work with social security organs, and so forth. The concentration of efforts presupposes a programmatic conception of the problem and the coordination of the actions of all elements of state power in the name of common goals. The cornerstone of the federal program is the formulation of priority normative acts and guidelines for law-giving activity aimed at lowering the level of crime and increasing the protection of the individual in general. But it is not enough to prepare the necessary legislative acts; it is also necessary to define clear mechanisms for their implementation and interaction. The first section of both parts of the program deals with this. The second part deals with crime prevention. It is important not only to detect crime and punish the culprits, but also to prevent it in good time. The priority measures projected in the federal program will enable us to increase society's protection against criminal infringements and to protect the individual from crime. Later in the program are two sections formulated for the sphere of specific actions. These include the fight against crimes against the individual, economic crime, and organized and gangland crime. It is necessary to dwell on the latter forms of crime in particular. For a considerable number of citizens crime has now become their major profession, and the level of organization among criminal formations is increasing. Whole criminal structures are being formed which are capable of 1nfluencing political and economic life in individual regions of Russia and in the country as a whole. Crime has become international. It is already spreading from Russia to remote foreign parts. But the nearby foreign parts are a separate question. We have too many links with the CIS countries. Apart from anything else, we still, unfortunately, have in effect a single criminal area. But now state mechanisms have been delineated. In this connection questions of interstate organizational collaboration between the CIS countries in this sphere are a priority. Common organizational and legal principles and specific interstate treaties are essential. In point of fact, this is why the program has appeared, because new problems cannot be resolved in the framework of the old relations and the mechanisms through which they were conducted. Many people worked on the compilation of the program. But above all I would like to note the work of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for Combating Crime and Corruption, which is headed by Minister of Justice Yuriy Khamzatovich Kalmykov. This commission will in fact most likely become the coordinating organ for the implementation of the program. Representatives of about 20 departments sit on this commission. The federal program was directly prepared and written by a group of 36 people. They are well-known academics, lawyers, executives, and economists. The program went through three stages of coordination with ministries and departments. It was subjected to expert study by eminent specialists. One of these was lawyer and academician Vladimir Nikolayevich Kurdryavtsev. Following the expert studies many criticisms were, as a rule, submitted to us. In all somewhere in the order of 1,500 were examined. The criticisms were taken into account in the final version of the draft program. As a result the document was not only professionally prepared, as was noted at the last session chaired by the secretary of the Security Council, but was also highly politically coordinated. The program was six months in preparation. Activity on the work was stepped up in late 1993. The contribution made by specialists of the sector for supporting the activity of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission was especially great. This sector is headed by Anatoliy Pavlovich Korotkov. All three versions of the program were precisely costed; after all, a program without resource backing is simply a slogan. The initial version was a wish list. It cost 16 trillion rubles [R], which was clearly unrealistic. It was necessary to lower our sights. The second version cost somewhere in the order of R10 trillion. This sum also proved to be out of the reach of the budget. In connection with this a dispute arose in the Interdepartmental Commission between the leaders of the law-enforcement departments and the financiers. Law-enforcement officials stated that they did not want to deceive society by projecting goals which were unattainable without resource backing. If we want to change the situation, the corresponding impact can be achieved only with additional investments. However, even in these disputes everyone understood that, given the rigid economy drive, it was necessary to decrease expenditure. The final version of the program was also thoroughly costed. It was reduced by almost half. However, it was decided at the Security Council session to carry out a further estimate in order finally to determine the level of funding. These funds have been distributed to the structures which are directly engaged in fighting crime. More than one-third is going to increase the cadres of the law-enforcement organs. We are a long way behind in information support, and a considerable proportion of the funds allocated will be spent on this. The rest will be spent on supplying weapons and special equipment, building premises for law and order organs, and other basic necessities. An unreasonable desire to economize in the fight against crime would mean us losing more than we gain. After all, in the law-enforcement spheres we count only the cost, disregarding the economic and social benefit. I will not go into all the finer details; I will say only that, according to the methods which are accepted in world practice and recommended by the United Nations, the benefit of law-enforcement measures is bound to exceed the cost by roughly twofold. That is talking money. But what figures do you use to assess the following fact: According to the forecasts of a Ministry of Internal Affairs scientific research institute, intensifying the fight against crimes against the individual will enable the lives of 20,000 Russian citizens to be saved. The Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight Against Crime has been examined on a working basis several times already. Almost all questions have been removed. The Security Council has expressed an on the whole positive attitude to the program and ordered it to be finalized within one week, taking account of the criticisms made in the Security Council, and then to be submitted for the president's approval. The government has been instructed to provide the funding for the program.
doc	FBIS3-17047	Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Report by Sergey Skorokhodov from "Neighboring Foreign States" roundup: "Kazakhstan -- Morals Will Be Policed"] [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Kazakhstan's government pins great hopes on the legal reform program adopted recently by President N. Nazarbayev. According to State Counselor K. Suleymenov, there are fewer burglars, thiefs, and muggers in the republic now, but more...call girls and racketeers. Crime has become an economy and a business. Passive work on the part of the internal affairs organs, the state counselor believes, is the main reason why organized forms of crime have started to flourish in the republic. "Unfortunately, gangs have established a strong foothold in our country." In view of this Kazakhstan's president signed a decree on stepping up the fight against crime. It provides for the creation of special investigative groups comprising staffers from the Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Committee which will fight organized crime. Moreover, the president adopted a decision to set up a tax militia. Henceforth in Kazakhstan, instead of the notorious LTP's [occupational therapy rehabilitation centers], LPU's -- preventive treatment establishments -- will come into operation under the Ministry of Health. Moreover, in view of the decline of moral standards, a morals militia will come into being. Among other things, it will deal with the morality of the press.

We now present the exclusive interviews with these Palestinian personalities: Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, the secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine, elaborated on the organization's stance on the killing of dozens of Palestinian Muslims in the mosque of the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon bim) in Hebron in an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Damascus. He said: This massacre was not at all unexpected, as the criminal Zionists have been perpetrating the most heinous crimes in the past 50 years against the Muslim Palestinian nation. He added: The criminal Zionists believe they can achieve their unholy objectives by martyring the greatest number of Palestinian Muslims and by driving the Palestinian nation out of the country. Regarding the joint plot by the Zionist armed forces and the Jewish settlers in carrying out the massacre, Dr. al-Shiqaqi stated: Naturally, the Zionist armed forces jointly carried out this crime, because, in the past, 40 soldiers have been on guard at the mosque round the clock. But at the time this crime was committed, only two or three soldiers were at the scene of the crime. They assisted the attacking settlers and provided them with the necessary arms and equipment to kill the greatest number of worshippers. He said: After committing the catastrophic crime, the criminals easily fled the scene with the help of the Zionist armed forces. He blamed the government of Yitzhaq Rabin for the crime and said: There is no doubt that the Rabin government had all the information on this crime before it was perpetrated and even prepared the conditions for killing the Palestinian Muslims. On the condemnation of the crime by Yasir 'Arafat, he said: It is absurd that Rabin and Clinton also condemned the crime, when they are accomplices to the crime, the natural result of the treasonous PLO accord with the Zionist regime plotted by the United States. On the future response by the Palestinian organizations to this atrocity, Dr. al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation does not fear intimidation or martyrdom and will continue the intifadah. The Palestinian guerrillas will, helped by almighty God, very soon deliver a shattering blow to the Zionists and those who have compromised with them. We will soon avenge the blood of the martyrs of the Hebron Mosque. Referring to the stances of international organizations on this crime, al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation pays no attention to these organizations' stances, as the United States is supervising them and using them. The international organizations claim to condemn the crime but have taken no important step to condemn the Zionist regime. The United States will never exert pressure on Israel for committing this crime. Commenting on the possibility of 'Arafat capitalizing on the crime at the mosque, the secretary general of Islamic Jihad in Palestine said: Instead of taking a stance against the Zionist regime, 'Arafat has agreed to accept the U.S. Government's invitation to continue talks with Rabin to rein in the intifadah. On principle, 'Arafat has become an agent for the policies of the United States and the Zionist regime to pave the way for killing more Palestinian Muslims. Concluding, he alluded to the stances of the United States and some of the Western and regional countries asking the Palestinian organizations not to carry out guerrilla operations and to confine themselves to political measures and stated: The United States and the countries above wish to draw our nation into a compromise and will not give the Palestinian organizations permission to take any political action. But the Palestinian nation is determined to continue its struggle and soon, the flames of our nation's fury will descend upon the Zionists and upon those who have compromised and lethal blows will be dealt by means of armed struggle against the Zionist regime. The PLO accord with the Zionist regime will be thrown in the dustbin of history. In his remarks to the KEYHAN correspondent, Nayif Hawatimah stated: The Zionist regime is the element behind the crime of killing the worshippers in al-Khalil and 'Arafat paved the way for its occurrence. According to Hawatimah, 'Arafat has made a two-faced statement. First, he claimed that a demented Israeli had committed the crime; he did this to prevent clashes from erupting and the intifadah from continuing. Second, 'Arafat openly held talks with Clinton and Rabin and accepted the Rabin-Clinton plan for reining in the Palestinian guerrilla operations. Hawatimah added: This atrocity has been committed as a result of the accord among the United States, Israel, and 'Arafat and this compromise has been the catalyst for the heinous atrocity in Hebron. Answering a question on whether he will only confine himself to political actions at this stage, Hawatimah declared: The DFLP has faith in political means and armed operations and will utilize every means to inflict a blow on the Israeli regime. He called on the Western countries to revoke all negotiations with the Zionist regime and asked the Arab countries to continue their economic siege of Israel. On the need for coordination among the Palestinian groups opposed to the trend of compromise, Hawatimah said: This coordination will continue without heeding the existing difficulties and the Palestinian organizations will continue to prepare the Palestinian nation for the intifadah and general strikes. According to Hawatimah, the United States does not comprehend the real internal problems of Palestine and 'Arafat has no standing in the Palestinian nation. He cannot direct or rein in the intifadah. He added: The Zionist regime's massacres must be halted and the UN forces should be sent to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for this purpose. Hawatimah stated: Extensive demonstrations continue on the West Bank, in Gaza, and in the Palestinian camps in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and general strikes have been announced for three days inside the occupied territories. The Zionists have given no privileges to 'Arafat and merely prepared themselves for committing more crimes against the Palestinian nation. Such crimes will continue to be perpetrated under the cover of the 'Arafat-Rabin accord. He also announced that the DFLP accepts UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and that the United Nations must send its troops to supervise the conditions inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip and should treat the occupied areas like those in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He appealed to Russia, the United States, and other countries to prevent new crimes against the Palestinians.
doc	FR940203-0-00059	NMFS has specified ``the manner and locations in which animals may be taken'' in these regulations (see regulatory text below). Depleted Species Comment: Several commenters noted the number of species requested for taking that are either depleted under the MMPA or threatened or endangered under the ESA (and should not be taken). Response: In 1986, both the MMPA and the ESA were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened marine mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, which meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine mammals could not be authorized even if the anticipated take would result in only negligible impacts. However, both the MMPA and ESA now specifically provide for authorization of such takes, so long as the requisite findings can be made. As required by the ESA, NMFS has consulted with the Navy under section 7 (refer to response under ``Endangered Species Act Concerns'' below for additional information on section 7 consultation). A copy of the Biological Opinion resulting from that consultation is available upon request (see ADDRESSES ). Incidental Take Comment: One commenter opposed the project because, among other things, estimated takes presented by the Navy are calculated from models that may be based on invalid assumptions. The commenter continues that even though NMFS believes the takes will have a proportionally minor impact on the large local populations of marine mammals, hundreds, if not thousands, of animals will be harassed by the detonations, while a sizable number will potentially be injured and killed. Response: The two assumptions that may not be valid were discussed fully in the application and the EA. These are (1) that species are distributed uniformly in space and time, and (2) that pinniped species are in the water all year. The first assumption is discussed in the following response and under ``Population Assessment Methodology,'' below. The latter assumption is misleading because many of these animals will be on the beach for 1&hyph;3 months during breeding and/or molting cycles; use of this assumption ( i.e., that all pinnipeds are in the water all the time) leads to a higher incidental take estimate, not a lower one. The negligible impact determination under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was discussed above. Comment: Two commenters were concerned that the distribution of marine mammals was difficult to predict because marine mammals exhibit associative, or clumped distributions. This, one of the commenters believes, could cause the incidental take number to be lower or higher than requested. Response: NMFS agrees. Those marine mammal species that tend towards group association could be subjected to a higher incidental take on a single detonation, provided their behavior also includes all individuals in the school diving at the same time, thereby making the entire pod or school invisible to observers. It is also just as likely that, because of grouping or clumping behavior, during the 4-week period for a ship shock trial, random distribution of the school(s) would mean that this species would not be within the safety zone at the time of testing, and therefore not subject to take. However, should the annual taking authorization for any species be reached, then any future takings would be considered to be in violation of the LOA, the implementing regulations and the MMPA. Comment: On a related issue, one commenter questioned whether it was a ``conservative approach'' to estimate mysticete (baleen whales) abundance (from which incidental take estimates are calculated), by using ``California-wide estimates and `scaling' them to the focal area.'' This commenter also questioned the incidental take calculations for California sea lions, since the females and young apparently remain in the area year-round. Response: NMFS believes the calculations for mysticete abundance is a conservative approach. As noted in the EA, during aerial surveys in the winter/spring period, blue whales were the only mysticete species observed within Area 2 ( i.e., the OSTR). Based upon this observation, an incidental take authorization for mysticetes should include only blue whales. However, because of the migratory nature of mysticetes, a conservative approach was taken, which was to request additional mysticete species based upon the method mentioned by the commenter. While California sea lions are the most abundant pinniped species in the SCB, because they are more likely to remain closer to islands and the coastline, fewer are expected to be in the area of the test. Therefore, fewer animals are anticipated to be incidentally taken. Comment: One commenter questioned the calculations for incidental take of northern fur seals because the EA stated that the species shared similar attributes with northern elephant seals. Response: The similar attributes northern fur seals share with northern elephant seals for the purposes of calculating the effectiveness of mitigation only, were the extended diving capability and the likelihood for northern fur seals to remain in the area most of the year.

(a) Publication. (1) The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register notice of a proposed revised List of Fisheries on or about July 1, 1990, 1991 and 1992, for the purpose of receiving public comment. On or about October 1, 1990, 1991, and 1992, the Assistant Administrator will publish a final revised List of Fisheries which will become effective January 1 of the next calendar year. (2) The proposed and final revised List of Fisheries will: (i) Categorize each commercial fishery according to the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and (ii) List the marine mammals and the estimated number of vessels or persons involved in each commercial fishery. (3) The Assistant Administrator may publish a revised List of Fisheries at other times, after notice and opportunity for public comment. The revised final List of Fisheries will become effective no sooner than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . (b) Categories. The List of Fisheries will be revised and commercial fisheries will be categorized into Category I, Category II or Category III according to the following criteria. In evaluating incidental takes for purposes of categorizing fisheries, the Assistant Administrator will consider the definition of take in section 3 of the Act, the language of section 114 of the Act and the legislative history of the 1988 amendments. (1) Category I. (i)(A) There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery; or (B) Congress intended that the fishery should be placed in Category I and there is no documented information indicating that it should be placed in another Category. (ii) ``Frequent'' means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. (2) Category II. (i)(A) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery; or (B) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional'' incidental taking in the fishery. (ii) ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period, but that there is little likelihood that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken.
doc	FR940617-0-00104	(3) Category III. (i)(A) There is information indicating no more than a ``remote likelihood'' of an incidental taking of a marine mammal in the fishery; (B) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is no more than a remote likelihood of an incidental take in the fishery; or (C) Congress intended that the fishery should be placed in Category III and there is not documented information indicating that it should be placed in another Category. (ii) ``Remote likelihood'' means that it is highly unlikely that any marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. §229.4 Prohibitions. (a) Prohibited activities. (1) It is unlawful for a commercial fishing vessel, a vessel owner, or a master or operator of a vessel to engage in a Category I or II fishery unless the vessel owner or authorized representative has complied with the requirements pertaining to registration, Exemption Certificates, decals and reports as contained in this part 229. (2) It is unlawful to assault, harm, oppose, impede, intimidate, impair or in any way interfere with an observer or the observations being carried out. (b) Prohibited taking. (1) Except as otherwise provided in part 17 of this title, part 216 of this chapter or this part 229, it is unlawful to take any marine mammal incidental to commercial fishing operations. (2) Under this part 229, it is unlawful to: (i)(A) Take any southern (California) sea otter; or (B) Intentionally lethally take any Steller sea lion, any Alaskan sea otter, any cetacean, any depleted species (including the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seal), or any endangered or threatened marine mammal. (ii) If the use of firearms or other means to deter marine mammals results in an injury or mortality of a marine mammal, the taking is presumed to be an intentional lethal taking. (3) Exemptions under this part 229 apply only to prohibitions under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and do not apply to prohibitions under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. To be exempt from the taking prohibitions under the Endangered Species Act, specific authority under that Act is required. (c) Other prohibitions. It is unlawful to violate any other provision of these regulations or the terms and conditions of Exemption Certificates. §229.5 Registrations for Category I and II fisheries. (a) Registrations. To engage lawfully in a Category I or II fishery after July 21, 1989, the vessel owner or authorized representative of the vessel owner must register for and receive an Exemption Certificate or annual renewal. Registrations should be submitted at least 30 days prior to the vessel engaging in a Category I or II fishery. The following information is required to register: (1) Name, address, and phone number of vessel owner; (2) Name and address of operator, if different from owner; (3) Vessel name, length and home port; state commercial vessel license number, Coast Guard documentation number, state registration number, and/or Tribal plaque number, where appropriate; (4) A list of all Category I and II fisheries that the vessel is expected to participate in during the calendar year (or during 1989 and 1990, if the registration is made during 1989), and the estimated number of trips from port for each fishery; and (5) A certification, signed and dated by the vessel owner or authorized representative, as follows: ``I hereby certify under penalty of perjury that I am the owner of the vessel or that I am authorized to register for this exemption on behalf of the owner, that I have reviewed all information contained on this document, and that it is true and complete to the best of my knowledge.'' (b) Fee. A check or money order made payable to NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, in the amount of $30.00 must accompany each registration or renewal. For good cause, the Assistant Administrator may waive the fee requirement.

ACTION: Issuance of scientific research permit no. 898 (P7721B65). SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038&hyph;0271, has been issued a permit to take Hawaiian monk seals ( Monachus schauinslandi ) for purposes of scientific research and to enhance the survival of the species. ADDRESSES: The permit and related documents are available for review upon written request or by appointment, in the following offices: Permits Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Room 13130, Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301/713&hyph;2289); Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802 (310/980&hyph;4016); and Marine Mammal Coordinator, Pacific Area Office, NMFS, 2570 Dole Street, Room 106, Honolulu, HI 96822 (808/955&hyph;8831). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 23, 1994, notice was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 8602) that a request for a permit to take Hawaiian monk seals had been submitted by the above-named organization. The requested permit has been issued under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq .), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .), and the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222). Issuance of this permit, as required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the endangered species which is the subject of this permit; and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the Endangered Species Act.
